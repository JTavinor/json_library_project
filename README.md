# milestone_2_improved

Please note I am aware it would probably be better to store the genre with each book individually. I structured the data storage in this
way to provide an additional challenge

An app to showcase understanding of python concepts including json files
An app that lets you add genres to a library and store books within these genres as a json file
You can also search by different criteria and delete books or genres
I have tried to allow for most outcomes, including:
 - Additional user checks if they try to delete a book that shares a name with another book
 - If the user tries to add an existing book
 - If the user makes a typo
 - If they try to add a book to a non-existant genre
 - Formatting the output nicely
